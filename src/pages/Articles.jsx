      "As someone who wished to become an advanced solidity smart contract developer, I took the initiative to begin my journey writing Yul so I could understand how data allocations are made to storage and memory and how to manage those allocations while cutting gas cost under the hood. I want to understand what happens to my solidity code at deployment and whenever a call is made.",

      "One of the common problems in DeFi is the difference in the smart contract implementation of yield-bearing protocols. For instance, Yearn allows you to deposit tokens into a vault and earn a yield on the tokens while they are deposited. Aave and Compound do similar things with their lending and borrowing contracts.",
